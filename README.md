# Network Protocols Project Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of progressively complex projects demonstrating key concepts and implementations in computer networking. Each project focuses on building protocol components from the ground up, simulating the network stack in practice.

---

## Project 1 – Network Sockets
**Description**:  
Fundamental examples using TCP and UDP sockets. Covers basic client-server communication, connection establishment, and message exchange.

---

## Project 2 – FTP Client
**Description**:  
Implements a simplified File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client. Demonstrates file transmission using sockets, control vs data connection handling, and command parsing.

---

## Project 3 – BGP Router
**Description**:  
Implements a basic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) router simulation. Handles session establishment, route advertisement, and path selection logic, approximating real-world inter-domain routing.

---

## Project 4 – TCP/IP Implementation
**Description**:  
Simulates the TCP/IP stack behavior, including manual IP packet handling, TCP connection state machines, and checksum calculation.

---

## Project 5 – Web Crawler
**Description**:  
A basic HTTP/1.1 web crawler. Handles socket-level HTTP requests, manual response parsing, and HTML traversal without using high-level HTTP libraries.

---

## Project 6 – DNS Server
**Description**:  
Implements a simplified Domain Name System (DNS) server. Supports query parsing, response generation, and local hostname-to-IP resolution.

### Summary

This portfolio demonstrates a deep understanding of core networking protocols and socket-level programming. The projects are arranged from foundational concepts to advanced protocol simulations, reflecting practical systems-level development skills.
